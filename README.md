# Datahub



The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and screencast videos. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.

###About Hubway

Hubway is a bicycle sharying system in the Boston area. Launched at the end of July in 2011, Hubway started with 61 stations throughout the city and 600 bicycles. In the time afterwards, Hubway expanded to the neighboring cities of Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline. Since its launch in 2011, Hubway has grown to more than 140 stations and more than 1300 bikes.
In 2013, Hubway in partnership with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, released data from more than a half million trips that were taken on Hubway bikes between its launch on July 28, 2011 until the end of September 2012. Their mission? Ask the public to put together a visualization of all the trip history. While the challenge itself has officially closed, we decided to take on the Hubway and MAPC visualization challenge.

###The Team Datahub Way

We are Team Datahub, and we are on a mission to visualize this bike sharing platform. As students, we make use of many forms of alternative transporation to explore and commute around Boston. In particular, bikes are a popular, affordable method of transportation for students, professionals, and tourists alike. We want to understand more about who uses bikes and for what purpose, as well as how people get around Boston. Our goal is to find answers to these questions for ourselves, and create a visualization for others to discover the answers as well.

###File Structure

The js libraries we used are located in the libs directory. We also used bootstrap and JPushMenu css libraries which are located in the css directory. Our html files are located in the root of the directory and the js files we wrote are in the js directory. We also included the python scripts we used to manipulate our data and get data from google direction in the data/scripts directory, and our data is located in the data directory.


### Non-Obvious Features

On each page there is a question mark icon in the top right corner that opens a modal which explains the page and explains how to properly use and manipulate the visualization.

### Process Book

Our process book is available as processbook.pdf as well as on our site at the url /process.html.
