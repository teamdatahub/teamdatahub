# Design Studio Feedback
We participated in the design studio peer feedback process with  *Shadi Fadaee, Kyle Franseen, and Jason Yu*.  We had a rather clear question to ask of our other group.  We were at a bit of a crossroads with trying to figure which design to pursue moving forward.  We had started out with the map view and had run into a few problems.  Therefore, we had started a secondary layout in the event we couldn't get the map view functional for our milestone.  This secondary layout was depicting the same information, but in a chord layout instead of a map.  We were wondering which design we should focus on moving forward.  Although the other group informed us that both were very helpful views, they felt that the map view was better at communicating what we wanted to get across.  This was very helpful because they brought us back to our initial questions that we were trying to solve.  Since one of our main questions was where are people traveling to/from, it seemed that if we could get the map working, that we should definitely use the map since it answers that question a bit clearer than the chord layout.  Using this feedback, we decided to scrap the chord layout for now and focus on the map view.  In the event that we had time at the end, it would be a potential extra feature.
